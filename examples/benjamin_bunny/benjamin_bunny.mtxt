text One morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.

text He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.

text A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.

text As soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip, and a
text jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.

text That wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived Benjamin's aunt and his
text cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.

text Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar).
text She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender).

text Little Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.

text He came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his Cousin Peter.

text Peter was sitting by himself. He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.

text "Peter," said little Benjamin, in a whisper, "who has got your clothes?"

text Peter replied, "The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden," and described how he had been chased about the garden,
text and had dropped his shoes and coat.

text Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that Mr. McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also;
text and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.

text Peter said he hoped that it would rain.

text At this point old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling: "Cotton-tail! Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!"

text Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.

text They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood. From here they looked down into
text Mr. McGregor's garden. Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o'-shanter
text of Mr. McGregor's.
